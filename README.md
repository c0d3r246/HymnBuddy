# HymnBuddy
My first mobile application using angular2/ionic/cordova/html5/css/javascript

I think there must be a solution like this already somewhere but I am learning the above tech so its a good opportunity to start me first git project. 

My Problem

I hate to walk around with excessive load when I'm going to church. I would like to load the songs from all of my hymnals into a mobile app so that I can use the hymns on the go. I also have the lyrics from songs which are not in a hymnal but I'd like to keep track of the lyrics for personal use as well. The application should allow the creation of containers so users can create their own personal repositories of hymns/song lyrics.

Strategy

Use ionic which is based on angular to provide the templating and programming logic
.NET Core/MVC build api to provide the songs from an internet database
internet database - research required Azure, SQL Server, MongoDB???
Cordova - Converts the compiled code from ionic to make native app for Android or IOS
Android App Store/ IOS App Store - research required
